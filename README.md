# DNS-practice
Assignment 8, HHA 504, AHI, SBU


1. Create a new github repo called 'DNS practice' 

2. Inside the repo, please create a simple flask app (can be your PssP or something else, I have no preference) - this flask app should then be deployed on a VM in either GCP or Azure 

3. Register a domain name using .TECH (be sure to have your github student account linked so it is FREE) - or if you have already purchased domains in the past and use something like godaddy, that is also fine [https://get.tech/github-student-developer-pack] 

4. Create a A record that links together the domain with the IP address of your flask app deployed on either GCP or Azure 

5. Create a markdown/readme file that contains the following information: 

    The name of your purchased domain 
    A copy of the 'A' record settings that you needed to write (name, value, TTL) 
    The cloud vendor you selected 
    Brief instructions if something were to want to re-recreate your app on their own cloud VM 

6. A "/photos" folder that contains screen shots of your live flask application deployed on your website 

7. Once completed, please feel free to shut down the instance/VM to save money - UNLESS you want to keep it live (e.g., maybe your are creating a personal CV website to show off your new skills....)



the website is gesun.tech

This website would potentially be used as a pseudo site to deploy any flask app and testing it out before presenting it to a client.
